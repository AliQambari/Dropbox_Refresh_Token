# Dropbox_Refresh_Token

When you generate an access token for the Dropbox API, it is typically short-lived, expiring after 4 hours (or less for some users). You can get a refresh token to extend the lifetime of your access and prevent it from expiring.

A refresh token is a special type of token that can be used to obtain a new access token. Access tokens are typically short-lived and expire after a certain period of time, such as an hour or a day. Refresh tokens, on the other hand, have a longer lifetime and can be used to obtain new access tokens without having to re-authenticate with the user.

Refresh tokens are useful for applications that need to maintain long-lived access to protected resources. For example, a mobile app that needs to access a user's Dropbox account can use a refresh token to obtain a new access token each time the app is launched, without having to prompt the user to log in again.
